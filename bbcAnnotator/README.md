# bbcAnnotator

A Java 8 Application to annotate samples from the BBC News Corpora downloaded from [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0677528/data.html).

The code is quite a mess, as it constantly mixes model and gui (javafx code). Sorry for that!

More details can be found in the file `INSTALL.md`.
